This is a machine-learning done in course <DS-GA-Introduction to Machine Learning> Fall2020 at NYU Center for Data Science, when I was a junior undergrad.

Team memebr: Yukun, Jiang & Yuhao, Ding & Junming, Cui

Brief description:
  
  In this project, we use VGG19 neutral network for gender prediction given people's facial images. We use transfer learning and retrain the last layer of the network architecture. In particular, we use 10-crops in data pre-processing for prediction stability.
  
For more detailed description, please see project poster and the ipython notebook. And also feel free to email me at jy2363@nyu.edu for any more information.
